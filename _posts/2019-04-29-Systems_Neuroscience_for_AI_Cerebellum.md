The traditional view of the cerebellum is that it refines movement. Given that so much valuable neuroscience had to be excluded from the guide, why then should such a limited brain region get a whole section? A modern view of the cerebellum affords it a much broader role, including in cognition. Before addressing this role with respect to the systems treated in previous sections, we must first consider it in isolation.

As a brief primer on on the well-studied circuitry and basic function of the cerebellum, I recommend this 10 minute video.

**Abstract**<br>
Twenty-five years ago the first human functional neuroimaging studies of cognition discovered a surprising response in the cerebellum that could not be attributed

 to motor demands. This controversial observation challenged the well-entrenched view that the cerebellum solely contributes to the planning and execution of movement. Recurring neuroimaging findings combined with key insights from anatomy and case studies of neurological patients motivated a reconsideration of the traditional model of cerebellar organization and function. The majority of the human cerebellum maps to cerebral association networks in an orderly manner that includes a mirroring of the prominent cerebral asymmetries for language and attention. These findings inspire exploration of the cerebellum’s contributions to a diverse array of functional domains and neuropsychiatric disorders.<br><br>
