If you have been following along by reading the reviews, we have now come a long way. In spite of the ground covered here, we have left untouched entire brain components such as the amygdala and claustrum, to name only two. Nevertheless, you should now have a very broad picture of what is happening and where in the brain - at least enough to serve as an informed springboard from which you can dive into the literature that you think will be most useful for inspiring progress in AI.

However, systems neuroscience is unlikely to be the only conceptual toolkit needed to build useful general intelligence. For that, other research agendas have much to contribute. To name just a few promising areas: multiagent learning and complex environments (a compelling manifesto for which can be found in Leibo et al. (2019)); abstract reasoning and symbolic computation in neural systems; ‘core’ ML topics such as improvements to optimisation algorithms or probabilistic deep learning; automated architecture search; and, orthogonally (but no less importantly), how we can build a general intelligence that actually does what we want and does it safely. These agendas should be seen as complementary to the systems neuroscience-centred agenda, rather than as contradictory. The systems neuroscience-centred agenda, however, is unique in that it can provide a rational framework for our thinking about general intelligence.
