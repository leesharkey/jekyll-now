<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm studying the Neural Systems and Computation MSc at UZH and ETH ZÃ¼rich. My background is in neurobiology and medicine (University of Cambridge) and data analytics (University of Glasgow). Formerly, I was a public health consultant with WHO. I'm interested in cognitive neuroscience from an AI perspective and vice versa, and I'm a proponent of Effective Altruism.

Out of the cradle<br/>  
onto dry land<br/> 
here it is<br/>   
standing:<br/>   
atoms with consciousness;<br/>  
matter with curiosity.<br/>   
<br/> 
Stands at the sea,<br/>   
wonders at wondering: I<br/>   
a universe of atoms<br/>   
an atom in the Universe.<br/>
