I'm studying the Neural Systems and Computation MSc at UZH and ETH ZÃ¼rich. My background is in neurobiology and medicine (University of Cambridge) and data analytics (University of Glasgow). Formerly, I was a public health consultant with WHO. I'm interested in cognitive neuroscience from an AI perspective and vice versa, and I'm a proponent of Effective Altruism.
