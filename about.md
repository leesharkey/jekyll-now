![Me](/images/jpegleebw.jpg)

I'm studying the Neural Systems and Computation MSc at UZH and ETH ZÃ¼rich. My background is in neurobiology and medicine (University of Cambridge) and data analytics (University of Glasgow). Formerly I was a public health consultant with WHO. My current interests are foundational cognitive science from an AI perspective, particularly mental 'start-up software' and AI architectures that emulate human and animal brains. I am a proponent of Effective Altruism and care deeply about the future of humanity and its values.
