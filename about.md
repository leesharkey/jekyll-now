I'm studying the Neural Systems and Computation MSc at UZH and ETH Zürich. My background is in neurobiology and medicine (University of Cambridge) and data analytics (University of Glasgow). Formerly I was a public health consultant with WHO. My current interests are foundational cognitive science from an AI perspective, particularly mental 'start-up software' and AI architectures that emulate human and animal brains. I am a proponent of Effective Altruism and care deeply about the future of humanity and its values.

The name of the blog, Metawondering, is a nod to Richard Feynman's well-known poem:

> ...  
> Out of the cradle  
> onto dry land  
> here it is  
> standing:  
> atoms with consciousness;  
> matter with curiosity.  
>
> Stands at the sea,  
> wonders at wondering: I  
> a universe of atoms  
> an atom in the Universe.
